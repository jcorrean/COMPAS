# COMPAS
This repository provide supplemental material to the paper titled: "A text mining approach for adapting a school-based sexual health promotion program in Colombia," (available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2020.101090)
The raw data is the file "COMPAS plano.txt." This text file should be splited into five different individual texts (each file contains the text of each session). 
All individual files should be saved in a same directory. Then, the R-script "CompasProgramAnalysis.R" could be applied straightforwardly to get Figure 1 of the published paper. Figures 2 and 3 were obtained with KHCoder and the Excel file.
KHCoder (https://khcoder.net/en/) is an independent development software that provides useful tools for quantitative content analysis or text mining.
