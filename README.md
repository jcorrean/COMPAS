# COMPAS
This repository provide supplemental material to the paper titled: "A text mining approach for adapting a school-based sexual health promotion program in Colombia," (available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2020.101090)
The raw data is the file "COMPAS plano.txt." This text file should be splited into five different individual texts (each file contains the text of each session). 
All individual files should be saved in a same directory. Then, the R-script "CompasProgramAnalysis.R" could be applied straightforwardly.
